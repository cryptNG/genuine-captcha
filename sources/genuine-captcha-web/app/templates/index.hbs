                        Typical CAPTCHA solutions on the web, while maybe effective in distinguishing human users from bots, can raise several privacy concerns: 
                    </p>
                    <ul>    
                        <li>Most <b>collect user data</b> like IP addresses, mouse movements, and browsing patterns, </li>
                        <li>Potentially <b>aggregating privacy data</b> for profiling or advertising. </li>
                        <li>Using <b>cookies</b> or tracking technologies and therefore raising GDPR-related concerns. </li>
                        <li>Many rely on third-party services, risking <b>unwitting data sharing</b>. </li>
                        <li>Some use invasive methods like keystroke monitoring and might <b>lack transparency</b> about data usage and storage. </li>
                        <li>The data gathered by CAPTCHA systems, if misused, could <b>compromise user privacy</b>. </li>
                       </ul> 
                        These issues underscore the need for more privacy-conscious CAPTCHA alternatives in web security.
